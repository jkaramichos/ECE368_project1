	mode 1 generate interarrival times

QUESTIONS:
1.) when is first arrival time? t = 0? or do we generate one?


NOTES:
1.) mode 2 read actual systme time for arrivals


next_customer = scan file for line 1
system_time = 0;

create customer node with data from line
{
	arrival_time = column1
	priority = column 2
	service_time = column_3
}



is server busy? 
no {


server = 1 
server_Customer = next_customer
next_customer = read next line


departure_time.server_customer = arrival_time + service_time


if (arrival_time.next_customer < departure_time.server_customer)
{
	system_time = arrival_time.next_customer;
}
else
{
	system_time = departure_time.server_customer;
}



}


yes {

	enqueue next customer
	next_customer = read next line (create new customer node)

	if(departure_time.server == system_time)
	{
		get data from the serviced customer
		pop next customer from queue
		update all server_customer variables
		delete the serviced customer

	}

	//update time
	if (arrival_time.next_customer < departure_time.server_customer)

		system_time = arrival_time.next_customer;
